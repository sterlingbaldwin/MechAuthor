# Output Format Contract

- Output must be valid Markdown.
- Use predictable headings and stable section names.
- Avoid free-form preambles not requested by task prompt.
- Do not include placeholders like "TBD" in final task output unless explicitly allowed.
- When updating list-based memory files, append entries without deleting canonical history.
